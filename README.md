# Customer Churn Analysis

## About the Project
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn and understanding how it impacts
revenue. The complete analysis is done using SQL, Python, and Power BI.  
The main objective is to identify churn patterns, customer behavior, and business areas
that need attention to reduce customer loss.

## Tools Used
- SQL – for data cleaning, joins, and aggregations
- Python – for data analysis and exploration
- Power BI – for building an interactive dashboard

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains customer information, subscription plans, usage data,
payment status, and churn flags. Multiple CSV files were combined and cleaned
before analysis.

## Project Process
1. Collected data from different CSV files  
2. Cleaned and merged data using SQL
